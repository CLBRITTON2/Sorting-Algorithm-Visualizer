# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer 
#### A sorting algothrithm visualizer that uses Windows Forms and C#.

- The application utilizes a random number generator to populate an array.
- Each number within the array is represented by a red bar.
- Each number's max value is determined by the height of the sorting panel. 
- The length of the array is determined by the width of the sorting panel.
- When the array is completely sorted all bars will turn green.

#### Algorithms in progress:
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Heap Sort

#### Completed Algorithms:
### Bubble Sort
