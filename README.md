# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer 
#### A sorting algothrithm visualizer that uses Windows Forms and C#

- This application utilizes a random number generator to populate an array
- Each number within the array is represented by a red bar
- Each number's max value is determined by the height of the sorting panel
- The length of the array is determined by the width of the sorting panel
- When the array is completely sorted all bars will turn green (not shown in examples)
